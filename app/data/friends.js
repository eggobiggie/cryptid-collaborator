This cryptid tends to have an unpleasant body odor, so be sure to pack some deodorant, and of course offer it nicely, otherwise he might not want to work with you. Our friend Sasquatch is sometimes a fan of leaving large footprints behind, which is an ideal scenario for sparking your friends' imaginations into a frightened frenzy!",

A slippery sort of fellow, this cryptid enjoys creating an ambiance of mystery and intrigue, only showing himself on occasion, and making sure to be seen only out of the corner of the eye, so no one can be truly sure about what they saw. With Nessie's help, your friends will never want to swim again!",
